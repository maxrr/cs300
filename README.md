# CS300 (Programming II) Projects

These are all of the projects that were assigned to me during the time I was taking this course. I didn't think far enough ahead to save the prompts for these projects, so the section under each project is just my best guess of what the project was trying to teach us.

## Project 1: Climbing Tracker

- Intro project, probably just an introduction to writing our own test cases
- Very basic array traversal, not really anything to write home about

## Project 2: Fish Tank 1000

- This project was an introduction to utilizing graphics, we used a third-party library 'p2core'
- Simple fish tank where we can add, remove, and drag fish

## Project 3: Exceptional Climbing

- More involved error checking, slightly more complicated output
- I believe this was an intro to Exceptions and how/when/if to throw them

## Project 4: Fish Tank 2000

- Expansion of Project 2, this time our fish tank has decoration
- Added functionality to start/stop all fish from swimming (wow!)

## Project 5: Fish Tank 3000

- Now we have different kinds of fish
- Added more interactability with various buttons to add the fish instead of having to use keybinds

## Project 6: Benchmarking Hacks

- Shows how inefficient code can be, re-introduction to Big-Oh notation
- Introduction to how 'protected' properties and methods interact with other properties and methods of different scopes

## Project 7: Folder Content Explorer

- This may have been our introduction to recursion?
- Provides a list of all files and folders in the directory provided to it

## Project 8: Linked Sorting

- Seems like this was our introduction to linked lists
- Gave us some context on how linked lists are different from array lists
- "Bookshelf" that uses nodes to represent books and can sort them based on different attributes

## Project 9: Tile Matching Game

- A text-based tile matching game
- Probably our introduction to stacks and FILO vs. FIFO as a concept

## Project 10: Binary Bookshelf

- A binary tree version of Project 8
- Can still sort on certain attributes, just like before

## Project 11: Assignment Planner

- Obvious from the name, but an assignment planner
- Uses min-heaps to make a priority queue for assignments that are due the soonest

I haven't found anything in the files that says I shouldn't be allowed to post this after completing the course, but if anyone has a problem with me posting this, please email me at max.r.rountree@gmail.com.
